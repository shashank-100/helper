        "body": "Hi Rachel,\n\nThank you for reaching out about the Business ID verification issue. The \"Business ID provided during account setup\" refers to the Employer Identification Number (EIN) or equivalent business registration number you entered when creating your seller account.\n\nTo locate and update this information:\n\n1. Go to Account Settings\n2. Select the \"Business Profile\" tab\n3. Look for the \"Tax Information\" section\n4. You'll find your registered Business ID there\n\nEnsure this number matches the one on your business registration documents. If you need to update it, you can do so in the same section. After updating, you'll need to resubmit your verification documents.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or run into other issues.\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel",
