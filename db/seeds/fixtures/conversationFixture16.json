I've checked your account and noticed that the error is occurring because the new card's billing zip/postal code doesn't match what's on file with the card issuer.<br><br>To resolve this, please:<br><br>1. Verify the billing address matches exactly what's on your credit card statement<br>2. Make sure there are no special characters in the address fields<br>3. If you're outside the US, use the appropriate postal code format for your country<br><br>I can also help you update this manually if you prefer. Just provide:<br>• The last 4 digits of the new card<br>• The billing zip/postal code<br>• The country<br><br>I'll make sure it gets updated correctly on our end.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Alex",
