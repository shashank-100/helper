Added valid payout details (bank account or PayPal)\n3. Provided a clear description of your products\n4. Updated your creator profile\n\nIf you've completed all these steps, I'll escalate your verification review to our compliance team. They'll prioritize reviewing your account within the next 24-48 hours.\n\nBest regards,\nEmily",
