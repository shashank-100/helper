I can see that while notifications are enabled on your account, there seems to be a sync issue between our server and your device. Let's try these steps to resolve it:<br><br>1. Force close the app<br>2. Go to iPhone Settings > [App Name] > Notifications<br>3. Toggle notifications off, wait 10 seconds, then toggle them back on<br>4. Relaunch the app and sign in again<br><br>I've also reset your notification tokens on our end, which should help establish a fresh connection.<br><br>Could you try these steps and let me know if you start receiving notifications? I'll send a test notification to your device once you confirm you've completed these steps.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Rachel",
