# Contributing to @helperai/react

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Helper React package! This document outlines the process for contributing and releasing new versions.

## Development

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing. Some key guidelines:

- Write tests in TypeScript
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test        # Run tests once
  npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
  ```

## Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Include screenshots of your test suite passing locally
5. Use native-sounding English in all communication with no excessive capitalization (e.g HOW IS THIS GOING), multiple question marks (how's this going???), grammatical errors (how's dis going), or typos (thnx fr update).
   - ❌ Before: "is this still open ?? I am happy to work on it ??"
   - ✅ After: "Is this actively being worked on? I've started work on it here…"
6. Create a changeset for your changes (see below)
7. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes

## Code Style

- Use functional React components
- Write TypeScript
- Follow existing code patterns
- Refer to the app as "Helper" (not "Helper AI")

## Managing Changes with Changesets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and changelogs.

### Adding a Changeset

When making changes, you need to include a changeset file describing your changes:

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx changeset
   ```

2. Select the type of change:

   - `major`: Breaking changes
   - `minor`: New features
   - `patch`: Bug fixes

3. Write a summary of your changes when prompted

4. Commit the generated changeset file with your changes

### Releasing a New Version

1. Build the package:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. Create a version PR:

   ```bash
   npx changeset version
   ```

   This will:

   - Update package versions based on changesets
   - Generate/update changelog
   - Remove changeset files

4. Review and merge the version PR

5. Create a release:

   ```bash
   npx changeset publish
   ```

   This will:

   - Publish packages to npm
   - Create git tags
   - Push changes

6. Push tags:
   ```bash
   git push --follow-tags
   ```
