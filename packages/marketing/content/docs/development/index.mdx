<Callout>
  Make sure you follow the Quick Start in the [README](https://github.com/antiwork/helper/blob/main/README.md) first!
</Callout>

## Docker Services

The app uses Docker to run the following services locally:

- Supabase
- Nginx (allowing you to use the `https://helperai.dev` domain)

`pnpm dev` will automatically start and stop these services, or you can use `pnpm services:start` and `pnpm services:stop` to start and stop them manually.

<Callout>
  Nginx will attempt to listen on port 80 and 443, so if you have other containers or services running on those ports
  you will need to stop them first.
</Callout>

## Database Management

Seed the database with sample data:

```sh
pnpm db:reset
```

Generate/run database migrations:

```sh
# Generate a migration to bring the database schema in sync with the definitions in db/schema
pnpm db:generate

# Apply any new migrations to the database
pnpm db:migrate
```

Note that `pnpm dev` will automatically run migrations, but won't generate them.

## Testing

```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific test file
pnpm test tests/jobs/postEmailToGmail.test.ts
```

## Background Tasks

This project uses Supabase Cron and Queues for background tasks.

## SSL certificates

The app uses a local Certificate Authority (CA) to generate SSL certificates for the `https://helperai.dev` domain.

The certificates will be automatically generated when you run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm db:reset`, for the first time. If you need to regenerate them you can use:

```sh
pnpm generate-ssl-certificates
```
