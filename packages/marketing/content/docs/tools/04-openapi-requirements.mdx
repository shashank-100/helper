# OpenAPI Requirements

Helper uses OpenAPI specifications to understand your API's capabilities and convert them into usable tools. To ensure optimal integration, your OpenAPI specification should meet certain requirements.

## Supported OpenAPI Versions

Helper supports:

- OpenAPI 3.0.x
- OpenAPI 3.1.x

Earlier versions (such as Swagger 2.0) may work but are not officially supported.

## Essential Components

Your OpenAPI specification should include:

### 1. Clear Operation IDs

Each endpoint should have a unique `operationId` that clearly describes the action:

```yaml
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      operationId: getUserById
      # ...
```

Helper uses these operation IDs to name and identify tools.

### 2. Detailed Descriptions

Include descriptions for:

- Each endpoint
- Parameters
- Request bodies
- Response schemas

```yaml
paths:
  /orders/{orderId}:
    get:
      operationId: getOrderById
      description: "Retrieves detailed information about a specific order"
      parameters:
        - name: orderId
          in: path
          required: true
          description: "The unique identifier of the order"
          schema:
            type: string
```

These descriptions help Helper understand when and how to use each tool.

### 3. Well-Defined Parameters

Clearly define all parameters, including:

- Type information
- Format constraints
- Whether they're required
- Default values (when applicable)

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: limit
    in: query
    description: "Maximum number of results to return"
    required: false
    schema:
      type: integer
      minimum: 1
      maximum: 100
      default: 20
```

### 4. Response Schemas

Define response schemas to help Helper understand the data structure returned by each endpoint:

```yaml
responses:
  200:
    description: "Successful operation"
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            id:
              type: string
            name:
              type: string
            # ...
```

## Authentication

If your API requires authentication, specify it in the OpenAPI document:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
```

Helper currently supports API key authentication, which can be specified during the API connection process.

## Best Practices

For optimal integration with Helper:

### Endpoint Organization

- Group related endpoints logically
- Use consistent naming conventions for paths and operations
- Keep the number of endpoints manageable (prioritize the most useful ones)

### Parameter Design

- Use descriptive parameter names
- Provide examples where helpful
- Define appropriate constraints (min/max values, patterns, etc.)

### Documentation

- Include comprehensive descriptions
- Document potential errors and status codes
- Provide examples of requests and responses

### Versioning

- Include version information in your specification
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly

## Example Specification

Here's a simplified example of a well-structured OpenAPI specification:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: E-commerce API
  description: API for managing orders and customers
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /orders/{orderId}:
    get:
      operationId: getOrderById
      description: Retrieve order details by ID
      parameters:
        - name: orderId
          in: path
          required: true
          description: The unique identifier of the order
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Order details retrieved successfully
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Order"
components:
  schemas:
    Order:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        customer:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Customer"
        items:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/OrderItem"
        total:
          type: number
          format: float
    # Additional schema definitions...
```

## Troubleshooting

If Helper has trouble parsing your OpenAPI specification:

- Validate your specification using tools like the [Swagger Validator](https://validator.swagger.io/)
- Check for missing required fields (operationIds, descriptions, etc.)
- Ensure your specification is accessible from the provided URL
- Verify that the specification follows the OpenAPI standard
