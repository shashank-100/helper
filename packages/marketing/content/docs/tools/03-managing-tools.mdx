# Managing Tools

After connecting your APIs to Helper, you'll need to manage the imported tools to ensure they're properly configured and available when needed.

## Tool Configuration

Each tool imported from your API can be individually configured:

### Enabling/Disabling Tools

By default, all imported tools are enabled, but you can disable specific tools if you don't want Helper to use them:

1. Navigate to the "Tools" section in your mailbox settings
2. Find the API containing the tools you want to manage
3. Toggle the switch next to each tool to enable or disable it

### Chat Availability

You can control which tools are available for Helper to use in chat conversations:

1. Find the tool you want to configure
2. Toggle the "Available in Chat" option
3. Only tools marked as available in chat will be accessible during conversations

This allows you to control which actions Helper can perform automatically when chatting with customers.

## Tool Usage

When a tool is enabled and available in chat, Helper can use it to:

1. Fetch information from your systems
2. Perform actions on behalf of your support team
3. Provide more accurate and contextual responses to customers

Helper intelligently determines when to use available tools based on the conversation context.

## Tool Updates

When you update your API's OpenAPI specification:

1. Helper will identify new endpoints and add them as new tools
2. Existing tools will be updated with any changes to their parameters or descriptions
3. Tools that no longer exist in the specification will remain but can be manually disabled

### Handling Changes

After updating your API specification:

1. Review the newly imported tools
2. Configure their availability in chat
3. Test the tools to ensure they work as expected with the new specification

## Best Practices

For optimal tool management:

- **Limit Chat Tools**: Only make essential tools available in chat to prevent unnecessary API calls
- **Use Clear Descriptions**: Ensure your OpenAPI specification includes clear descriptions for each endpoint
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your API specification up to date to ensure Helper has the latest capabilities
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review which tools are being used and adjust availability accordingly
- **Test After Updates**: Always test your tools after updating your API specification

## Security Considerations

When managing tools, keep these security considerations in mind:

- Only connect APIs that you want Helper to have access to
- Use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions
- Regularly rotate API keys for enhanced security
- Consider implementing rate limiting on your API to prevent excessive usage
