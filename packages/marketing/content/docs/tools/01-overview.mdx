# Tools

Helper's Tools feature allows you to connect your APIs to Helper, enabling it to take actions in your application when drafting replies to your customers. By integrating your APIs through OpenAPI specifications, Helper can perform tasks like checking order status, updating user information, or fetching relevant dataâ€”all without leaving the conversation.

## How It Works

Helper uses OpenAPI specifications (formerly known as Swagger) to understand your API's capabilities. When you connect an API to Helper:

1. Helper parses your OpenAPI specification
2. Available endpoints are converted into tools that Helper can use
3. These tools become available to Helper when drafting replies
4. Helper can then make API calls on your behalf to perform actions or retrieve information

This integration creates a powerful workflow where Helper can not only respond to customer inquiries but also take action to resolve their issues.

## Key Benefits

- **Reduce Context Switching**: Helper can fetch information or perform actions without agents leaving the conversation
- **Faster Resolution**: Automate common tasks directly from the conversation
- **Consistent Execution**: Ensure API calls are made with the correct parameters every time
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Provide more immediate and actionable responses
