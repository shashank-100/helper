# Connecting APIs

Helper can integrate with your existing APIs through OpenAPI specifications, allowing it to perform actions in your application when helping your customers.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your API to Helper, ensure you have:

1. An OpenAPI specification (version 3.0 or higher) for your API
2. API credentials if your API requires authentication
3. Access to your Helper mailbox settings

## Connection Process

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access API Settings

Navigate to your mailbox settings and find the "Tools" section. This is where you can manage all your API connections.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add a New API

Click the "Connect API" button to start the connection process.

</Step>

<Step>
### Provide API Details

You'll need to provide the following information:

- **API Name**: A descriptive name for your API
- **OpenAPI Spec URL**: The URL where your OpenAPI specification is hosted
- **API Key** (optional): If your API requires authentication, provide the API key

</Step>

<Step>
### Import Tools

After providing the necessary information, Helper will:

1. Fetch the OpenAPI specification from the provided URL
2. Parse the specification to identify available endpoints
3. Convert these endpoints into tools that Helper can use
4. Display the imported tools for your review

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Tools

Once the tools are imported, you can:

- Enable or disable specific tools
- Configure which tools are available in chat
- Set up any additional parameters required for the tools

</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

Helper supports API key authentication for your APIs. When connecting an API that requires authentication:

1. Provide your API key during the connection process
2. Helper securely stores this key and uses it when making API calls
3. All API calls are made server-to-server, keeping your API key secure

## Updating API Connections

You can update your API connections at any time:

1. Navigate to the "Tools" section in your mailbox settings
2. Find the API you want to update
3. Click the edit button to modify the API details
4. You can update the OpenAPI spec URL, API key, or other settings
5. Helper will re-import the tools based on the updated specification

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when connecting your API:

- Ensure your OpenAPI specification is valid and accessible
- Check that the API key has the necessary permissions
- Verify that your API is accessible from Helper's servers
- Review the error messages in the Helper interface for specific issues
