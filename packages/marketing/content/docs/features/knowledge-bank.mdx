## How Knowledge Bank Works

When a user sends a message, Helper retrieves relevant knowledge bank entries and adds them to the system prompt before generating an AI response. The knowledge bank helps Helper maintain consistency in how it handles specific topics, answers common questions, and follows your organization's policies.

## Creating Effective Knowledge Bank Entries

You can format entries however you like - there are no particular rules. However, shorter and more focused entries tend to be easier to manage than lengthy ones. Try to keep entries:

- **Clear and direct** - Provide straightforward instructions that the AI can easily follow
- **Focused on one topic** - Generally, each entry should address a single topic or issue
- **Concise** - Aim for roughly one instruction per entry, up to a few sentences
- **Specific** - Include specific details about how to handle certain questions or situations

## Example Knowledge Bank Entries

Here are some examples of effective knowledge bank entries:

> Do not promise to generate reports or documents for anyone. Just escalate the ticket to a human.

> If a customer cannot log in to see the purchases they just made as a new customer, explain that purchases were made under their email without setting up an account. Until they create an account, they can only access purchases from the receipt email. Advise them to sign up and create an account using the same email ID as their purchases.

> We don't provide support for Gumroad-related questions here, such as refunds. Users should use the Helper-powered chat on gumroad.com for that.

## Improving Knowledge Bank with Feedback

Helper can suggest improvements to your knowledge bank when you provide feedback about AI responses:

1. Click the "Flag as bad" button on an AI message and describe why the response was bad
2. Helper will analyze the flagged message and your feedback
3. A suggestion to create a new entry or update an existing one may be added to the knowledge bank

This feedback loop helps you continually improve Helper's response quality.

## Managing Knowledge Bank Entries

You can add, edit, and remove knowledge bank entries from your mailbox settings. Entries can be enabled or disabled as needed, allowing you to experiment with different instructions and see how they affect AI responses.
