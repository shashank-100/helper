          <h3>Data Collection and Use</h3>
          Helper accesses your Gmail account data via Google APIs under the following scopes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify</code>: Allows Helper to read, compose, send, and
              permanently delete all your emails from Gmail.
            </li>
          </ul>
          We use this access to fetch emails related to customer support inquiries and to allow our AI to draft
          responses. Emails fetched and drafts created are used solely for the purpose of enhancing your customer
          support capabilities. Helper does not use the data obtained through Google Workspace APIs to develop, improve,
          or train generalized AI or ML models.

          <h3>Data Storage and Sharing</h3>
          Data fetched from Gmail is stored securely on our servers to enable ongoing support and functionality of
          Helper. We do not share your email data with any third parties, except as necessary to provide the
          functionalities of Helper or as required by law.

          privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When the data retention
          period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it. You may request for your data to be
